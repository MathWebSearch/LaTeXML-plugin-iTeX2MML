# A LaTeXML Plugin for iTeX2MML

[iTeX2MML](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MML.html) is a utility and library that takes text with embedded itex equations, converts the itex equations to MathML, and outputs the resulting text.

With the iTeX2MML plugin in this [LaTeXML](https://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/) can do the same, but also create content markup, e.g. for the use in [MathWebSearch](https://kwarc.info/systems/mws/).
